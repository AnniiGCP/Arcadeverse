# Extraction Summary

This document summarizes what has been extracted from the original Arcade Calculator project and organized into a clean, reusable backend.

## What Was Extracted

### ✅ Core Calculation Logic
- **Badge Type Detection**: Automatically categorizes badges into game, trivia, skill, completion, and lab-free types
- **Points Calculation**: Calculates points based on badge types with special rules for different badge categories
- **Milestone System**: Supports facilitator milestone calculations with bonus points
- **Date Filtering**: Only counts badges earned after January 8th, 2025
- **Special Badge Rules**: Handles special 2-point game badges and skill badge grouping

### ✅ Backend API
- **Express Server**: RESTful API with CORS support
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Cheerio to scrape badge data from Google Arcade profile URLs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Server status monitoring

### ✅ Configuration Data
- **Game Badge Keywords**: Complete list of keywords to identify game badges
- **Skill Badges**: Complete list of all valid skill badge names
- **Lab-Free Badges**: Complete list of all valid lab-free badge names
- **Milestone Points**: Point values for each milestone level
- **Milestone Requirements**: Badge count requirements for each milestone level

## What Was NOT Included

### ❌ Frontend Components
- React components and UI
- Styling (CSS, Tailwind)
- Frontend routing
- User interface elements

### ❌ Build Configuration
- Vite configuration
- Frontend build tools
- Frontend dependencies

### ❌ Deployment Files
- Docker configuration (except basic example)
- Netlify configuration
- Render configuration

## Key Features Preserved

### 1. Badge Classification System
- **Game Badges**: Regular (1 point) and special (2 points)
- **Trivia Badges**: All worth 1 point
- **Skill Badges**: 1 point per 2 badges (rounded down)
- **Completion Badges**: No points
- **Lab-Free Badges**: No points

### 2. Milestone System (Facilitators Only)
- **Milestone 1 (25%)**: +2 points
- **Milestone 2 (50%)**: +8 points
- **Milestone 3 (75%)**: +15 points
- **Milestone 4 (100%)**: +25 points

### 3. Date-Based Filtering
- Regular points: Only badges after January 8th, 2025
- Milestone points: Only badges after April 1st, 2025

### 4. Web Scraping Logic
- Extracts badge names and earned dates from Google Arcade profiles
- Handles date parsing from various formats
- Filters and validates badge data

## Usage Options

### Option 1: Pure Calculation Logic
Import only the calculation functions for use in other projects:
```typescript
import { calculateArcadePoints, Badge } from './src/calculationLogic';
```

### Option 2: Full Backend API
Use the complete backend with web scraping:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Option 3: Custom Integration
Copy specific functions and modify as needed for your project requirements.

## Benefits of This Extraction

1. **Modularity**: Calculation logic is separated from UI and server concerns
2. **Reusability**: Can be easily integrated into any project
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code structure
4. **Flexibility**: Can be used with or without web scraping
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to modify badge lists, point values, and rules

## Integration Examples

The extraction includes:
- **React integration example** in INTEGRATION.md
- **Vue.js integration example** in INTEGRATION.md
- **Pure TypeScript usage examples** in example-usage.ts
- **API usage examples** with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the backend directory
2. **Build the Project**: Run `npm run build`
3. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start`
4. **Integrate with Your Project**: Use the provided examples and integration guide
5. **Customize as Needed**: Modify badge lists, point values, or milestone requirements

This extraction provides you with a complete, production-ready calculation engine that can be easily integrated into any new project while maintaining all the original functionality and accuracy.
